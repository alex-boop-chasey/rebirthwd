Core Approach (Features)
- Tagline: Core Approach
- Heading: Modern web architecture, done properly
- Subtitle: This is how contemporary websites are built for speed, resilience, and scale.
- Feature: Astro + Tailwind Stack
  - ReBirth builds with the Astro and Tailwind framework to eliminate the PHP and database bloat found in traditional CMS platforms. This results in content delivery with zero unnecessary JavaScript and a high-performance UI.
- Feature: Modular Component Architecture
  - ReBirth utilizes a modular component library to ensure code consistency. This architecture prevents "CSS leak" and makes the site easier to scale without the fragility and bloat of third-party WordPress plugins.
- Feature: Static Site Security
  - ReBirth removes common attack vectors like databases and admin login portals. By deploying via Static Site Generation (SSG), the site is effectively un-hackable and significantly more stable than legacy platforms.
- Feature: Lighthouse Performance
  - ReBirth optimizes for 100/100 Lighthouse scores. By pre-rendering the entire site at build time, users experience instant page transitions and superior performance that leaves traditional sites behind.
- Feature: Technical SEO
  - ReBirth bakes SEO directly into the source code. Using Astro's native capabilities for semantic HTML and automated metadata ensures the site is structured to be crawled and ranked efficiently from day one.
- Feature: Git-Based Workflow
  - ReBirth operates with a professional Git-based deployment pipeline. This includes automated testing and version control, allowing for seamless updates, transparent development, and instant rollbacks if needed.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
- Tagline: FAQs
- Heading: Frequently Asked Questions
- Subtitle: Here are the questions I hear most often about ReBirth Web Design. If your question isn’t answered below, feel free to reach out—I’m happy to chat.
- Q: Why choose ReBirth Web Design for my project?
  - I focus on fast, modern static websites built with Astro and Tailwind CSS—delivering standout design, blazing speed, and 90+ Lighthouse scores out of the box. Every site is mobile-first, accessible, SEO-ready, and tailored to your vision without unnecessary complexity or bloat.
- Q: What kinds of projects do you take on?
  - My core expertise is in high-quality static sites: portfolios, business landing pages, marketing sites, documentation hubs, and personal brands. I’m also open to light dynamic features (e.g., forms, search, or simple APIs) when they add real value, all while keeping performance and maintainability first.
- Q: How long does it take to build a website?
  - A focused prototype can be ready in just a few days. Full custom sites typically take 2–4 weeks from kickoff to launch, depending on scope and feedback rounds. I work iteratively—quick wins early, refinements along the way—so you see progress fast.
- Q: What do you need from me to get started?
  - Clear goals, any existing branding/assets (logo, colors, photos), content (or a plan for it), and reference sites you love. If you’re not sure about any of that, I can guide you through discovery and help shape the direction.
- Q: How much does a website cost?
  - Pricing is custom and transparent based on your needs. I offer a limited number of pro-bono or heavily discounted sites each year to build momentum and portfolio pieces. Paid projects start in the mid-four-figure range for bespoke, high-performance sites. I’ll provide a detailed quote after our initial discussion.
- Q: Do you offer maintenance or updates after launch?
  - Yes. I can hand off the full source code for you or your team to manage, or I can provide ongoing support (updates, new sections, performance tweaks) on a monthly retainer or per-request basis—whatever fits your workflow best.
