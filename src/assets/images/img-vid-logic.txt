Yes — here's the calculated percentages (rounded to 4 decimals for precision) based on your image's 1500px width:

- Left position: **12.5333%** (from 188px / 1500px)
- Video width: **74.6667%** (from (1308px - 188px) / 1500px = 1120px / 1500px)

For the top position percentage, I need your image's **height in pixels** (open the .webp in Preview on Mac > Tools > Show Inspector > Dimensions tab). Once you have it (e.g., say 1000px), calculate top % as `(120 / height) * 100` — for example, if height=1000px, top=12%.

Copy-paste this exact block to Claude for coding the CSS:

> "My laptop mockup image is 1500px wide [and HEIGHTpx tall — insert your height].  
> Screen starts at X=188px, Y=120px from top-left.  
> Screen area is 1120px wide (height doesn't matter — keep video aspect ratio).  
> Percentages: left=12.5333%, top=[your calculated %], width=74.6667%, height=auto.  
> Please write responsive CSS for a container with the image as z-index:2 overlay frame, and <mux-player> or <video> absolute-positioned at z-index:1 to fill the screen area exactly, maintaining 16:9 aspect on the video."

Claude will generate spot-on code from that. If you share the height, I can calc the top % too!
